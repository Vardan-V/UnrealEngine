## **Description**

Crypt Raider is a first-person puzzle game project I worked on using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. The Objective of this game is for the player to reach the end of the crypt and successfully leave with the golden statue. The player will have to discover secrets and solve puzzles to accomplish this task.
